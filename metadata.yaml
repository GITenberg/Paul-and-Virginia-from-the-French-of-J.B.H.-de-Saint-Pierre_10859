description: "Paul et Virginie (or Paul and Virginia) is a novel by Jacques-Henri\
  \ Bernardin de Saint-Pierre, first published in 1788. The novel's title characters\
  \ are friends since birth who fall in love. The story is set on the island of Mauritius\
  \ under French rule, then named Île de France. Written on the eve of the French\
  \ Revolution, the novel is recognized as Bernardin's finest work. It records the\
  \ fate of a child of nature corrupted by the artificial sentimentality of the French\
  \ upper classes in the late eighteenth century. Bernardin de Saint-Pierre lived\
  \ on the island for a time and based part of the novel on a shipwreck he witnessed\
  \ there.\nBernardin de Saint-Pierre's novel criticizes the social class divisions\
  \ found in eighteenth-century French society. He describes the perfect equality\
  \ of social relations on Mauritius, whose inhabitants share their possessions, have\
  \ equal amounts of land, and all work to cultivate it. They live in harmony, without\
  \ violence or unrest. The author's beliefs echo those of Enlightenment philosophers\
  \ such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau. He argues for the emancipation of slaves. He was\
  \ a friend of Mahé de La Bourdonnais, the governor of Mauritius, who appears in\
  \ the novel providing training and encouragement for the island's natives. Although\
  \ Paul and Virginie own slaves, they appreciate their labour and do not treat them\
  \ badly. When other slaves in the novel are mistreated, the book's heroes confront\
  \ the cruel masters.\nThe novel presents an Enlightenment view of religion: that\
  \ God, or \"Providence,\" has designed a world that is harmonious and pleasing.\
  \ The characters of Paul et Virginie live off the land without needing technology\
  \ or man-made interference. For instance, they tell time by observing the shadows\
  \ of the trees. One critic noted that Bernadin de Saint-Pierre \"admired the forethought\
  \ which ensured that dark-coloured fleas should be conspicuous on white skin\",\
  \ believing \"that the earth was designed for man’s terrestrial happiness and convenience\"\
  .\nThomas Carlyle in The French Revolution: A History, wrote: \"[It is a novel in\
  \ which] there rises melodiously, as it were, the wail of a moribund world: everywhere\
  \ wholesome Nature in unequal conflict with diseased, perfidious art; cannot escape\
  \ from it in the lowest hut, in the remotest island of the sea.\"\nThe novel's fame\
  \ was such that when the participants at the Versailles Peace Conference in 1920\
  \ considered the status of Mauritius, the New York Times headlined its coverage:\n\
  \n\"Sentimental Domain\"\nIsland of Mauritius, Scene of Paul et Virginie, Seeks\
  \ Return to French Control\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
